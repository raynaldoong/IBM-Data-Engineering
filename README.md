# IBM-Data-Engineering

## Course Description
Data engineering is one of the fastest-growing tech occupations, where the demand for skilled data engineers far outweighs the supply. The goal of data engineering is to make quality data available for fact-finding and data-driven decision making. This Specialization from IBM will help anyone interested in pursuing a career in data engineering by teaching fundamental skills to get started in this field. No prior data engineering experience is required to succeed in this Specialization. The Specialization consists of 5 self-paced online courses covering skills required for data engineering, including the data engineering ecosystem and lifecycle, Python, SQL, and Relational Databases.

The ipynb files uploaded to this repository are all the **python** exercises required for the completion of this specialization. As some of the exercises are done in IBM-DB2 and IBM's own virtual learning platform, only some of the jupyter notebooks can be uploaded to this repository.
